### Welcome to my internet home

Call me [Garrett](bio.Rmd). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Oregon. 

<br>

### Research
My dissertation explores climate change policy and criminal justice. 
I believe that descriptive work is valuable. I believe we are having a reproduction issue. I believe the best research is inter-disciplinary.

My philosophy is to use economics to make the world a better place.
