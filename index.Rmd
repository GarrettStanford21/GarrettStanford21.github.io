### Welcome to my internet home

My name is [Garrett Stanford](bio.html), and I currently work as a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Agriculture and Applied Economics](https://agecon.uga.edu/) at the University of Georgia. 

<br>

I completed my Ph.D. in economics at the University of Oregon in 2023, advised by Professors [Edward Rubin](https://edrub.in/), [Trudy Ann Cameron](https://pages.uoregon.edu/cameron/vita/), and [Jonathan Davis](https://sites.google.com/site/jonathanmvdavis/).

<br>

### Research

I am a public economist who wears several hats. My [research](research.html) focuses on environmental and criminal justice issues. I am particularly motivated by distributional impacts and questions concerning equity.
