### Welcome to my internet home

Call me [Garrett](bio.html). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Oregon.

<br>

### Research

I am an applied microeconomist who loves running experiments. My [research](research.html) is motivated by social justice, particularly issues concerning the environment and policing. I believe that descriptive work is valuable. I believe we are having a replication crisis. And I believe the best research comes from inter-disciplinary collaboration.

My [job market paper](papers/Stanford_2022_JMP.pdf) uses a field experiment to examine the issue of discriminatory policing practices in the United States.
