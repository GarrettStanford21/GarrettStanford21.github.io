I am an Oregon native and grew up in Portland. I did my undergrad at the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/) in Tacoma, WA. At Puget Sound, I was halfway through a degree in English before making a *hard* pivot and getting degrees in economics and Japanese. After graduating from the University of Puget Sound, I moved to [湯前町 (Yunomae), Japan](https://earth.google.com/web/data=MkEKPwo9CiExVEc3VDhRYzFOdnBzamdXQXJ2a0s2eFRGWTFkNm1JWlgSFgoUMDBDOUJCMzk0NzI1MTNBRTQwNkEgAQ) for a couple years to teach English. I returned to Oregon in 2017 to start a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Oregon in Eugene.

In Eugene, I live with my partner (not featured) and my turtle (featured). When I am not working on my degree, I am playing/talking about/thinking about basketball. I have also been known to go on outdoor adventures--weather permitting...
