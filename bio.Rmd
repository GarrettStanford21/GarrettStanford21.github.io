I am an Oregon native and grew up in Portland. I did my undergrad at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA. At Puget Sound, I was halfway through a degree in English before pivoting (hard) and getting degrees in economics and Japanese. After graduating from the University of Puget Sound, I moved to 湯前町 (Yunomae) Japan for a couple years to teach English. I returned to Oregon in 2017 to start a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Oregon.
