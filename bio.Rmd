I was born and raised in Portland. I received my undergraduate degree from the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/) in Tacoma, WA. At Puget Sound, I was halfway through a degree in English before making a *hard* pivot toward degrees in economics and Japanese. 

<br>

After graduating from the University of Puget Sound, I moved to [湯前町 (Yunomae), Japan](https://earth.google.com/web/data=MkEKPwo9CiExVEc3VDhRYzFOdnBzamdXQXJ2a0s2eFRGWTFkNm1JWlgSFgoUMDBDOUJCMzk0NzI1MTNBRTQwNkEgAQ) for a couple years to teach English. In Japan, I spent my time studying the language, riding trains, and searching for hidden swimming holes.

I returned to Oregon in 2017 to start a Ph.D. in economics at the University of Oregon in Eugene. After completing my degree in June of 2023, I packed up my house and drove to Athens, Georgia.

In Athens, I work as a postdoc in the University of Georgia's Department of Agriculture & Applied Economics (it's a mouthful). I live with my partner (not featured) and my turtle (featured). In my free time, I am an amateur etymologist, basketball enthusiast, and AC czar.
